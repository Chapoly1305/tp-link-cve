# CVE-2024-35495

Identified vulnerabilities in the TP-Link Tapo P125M and Kasa KP125M allow attackers to infer device status by observing network traffic, causing information disclosure.

**Keywords:** Information Disclosure

## Description
Affected devices report their status to the cloud with a predictable pattern, which can be used to infer the device state. These vulnerabilities are triggered either by users sending on/off commands to the devices or by manually turning the devices on/off using their power buttons.

## Replication Steps
Observe the traffic and packet lengths between the affected device and remote server. The P125M generates a consistent length pattern of 331-123-54 and 315-123-54 when toggling the power state. The KP125M generates a consistent pattern of 331-123-54.
