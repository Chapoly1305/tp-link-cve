# CVE-XXXX-C (Awaiting CVE ID)

An improper implementation of TP-Link MQTT Broker and API gateway do not enforce the consistency of device identity, which may allow an authenticated attacker to impersonate another legitimate device and report its device property, prevent legal user accessing the device from the mobile application.

**Keywords:** Horizontal Privilege Escalation, API Security

## Description
The TP-Link MQTT Broker and API gateway have an improper implementation that fails to enforce consistency of device identity. This vulnerability allows an authenticated attacker to impersonate another legitimate device, report false device properties, and potentially prevent the legitimate user from accessing the device through the mobile application.

The issue stems from inadequate validation of the deviceId in API requests, particularly in the /common/v1/uploadDeviceInfo path. While the API validates the deviceId and deviceToken in the request parameters, it fails to properly validate the deviceId present in the request body. This oversight allows an attacker to modify the deviceId in the body and affect other devices.

## Replication Steps
1. Obtain a legitimate TP-Link device and authenticate it with the MQTT broker.
2. Intercept MQTT messages sent to the $tpiot/things/CLIENT_ID/proxy topic.
3. Modify the deviceId in the body of the /common/v1/uploadDeviceInfo API request, replacing it with the deviceId of another user's device.
4. Send the modified request through the authenticated device.
5. Observe that the properties of the target device are altered in the mobile app display.

## Analysis
**CVSS:3.0 6.4 Medium**

Vector: AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:L/A:L

- AV: Network. The attacker can exploit this vulnerability in any node between device and TP-Link Cloud service, e.g., ISP, IDC.
- PR: Low. Attacker must first acquire a device which can authenticate itself before performing further attack.
- S: Changed. Attackers may inject messages and affect the display information on mobile App.
- AC: Low. The attack can be easily replicated and automated. This issue can always be reproduced.
- C: None. Attacker is unable to retrieve information from this vulnerability.
- I: Low. An attacker may affect device properties displayed on mobile App.
- A: Low. Attacker may cause a device to be inaccessible by sending incorrect properties and affect mobile App logic. The attack does not persist, and the device is not damaged.
